# ImageClassify
Dog Breed Classifier using CNN and Transfer Learning implemented in Keras

* The classifier uses  bottleneck feature of VG13C Inception Model. This model is then appended to max pooling layer which is then feed into output layer after flattening

* The Project was submiitted to acquire Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree
